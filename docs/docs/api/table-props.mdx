# Table props

### items (required)

- Type: `T[]`

  Array of any items that make up the table rows.

### id (required)

- Type: `((item: T) => string | number) | KeyOfType<T, string | number>`

  An id must be provided for each item, which is used as key to rows and to correlate several states to items (e.g. selection, expanded items, ...).
  The `id` props must either be a function that returns an item's id or a string that is the item's id's name.

  For example for items of type `{ id: number, name: string }` you would pass `id={item => item.id}` or `id="id"`.

### columns (required)

- Type: `Column<T, any>[] | ((col: <V>(value: (item: T) => V, column: Omit<Column<T, V>, 'value'>) => Column<T, V>) => Column<T, any>[])`

  To define columns, either pass an array of column definitions or a helper function.
  The latter is useful if you are using TypeScript because it infers the column's value's type from the first argument.
  See [Columns](/docs/guide/columns) for more information.

### parentId

- Type: `((item: T) => string | number) | KeyOfType<T, string | number>`

  Create a nested structure by assigning parents to items.
  Child items are hidden until the parent is expanded.

### hasDeferredChildren

- Type: `(item: T) => boolean`

  If true for an item, it means that children will be loaded asynchronously as soon as item is expanded.

### rowAction

- Type: `ReactNode | ((item: T, index: number) => ReactNode)`

  Display a cell at the start of each row. Useful for "go to details" button for example.

### defaultSort

- Type: `Sort[]`

  Default sort order.

### sort

- Type: `Sort[]`

  If given, controls the sort order.

### onSortChange

- Type: `(sort: Sort[]) => void`

  Called when sort order changes.
